Starting this website
-------

The entire point of this website is to showcase the ability to create a website that looks good, conveys meaning 
and is easy to use. This website would need to be easily scalable, have decent functionality, 
and effectively utilise the components/routes that React is leveraged upon. 

Planning phase
--- 

This website started off how most things do, in the planning phase. Basic functionality was planned out such as the menu,
what pages there would be?, what components would be needed? Once that was done, I needed a colour scheme - something simple,
like, blue, white and (dark) grey; all of which are easy to use neutral colours. Next, I set out to create a few sketches of what
i wanted on each page - blog post lists, a top menu, a list of projects, etc. I then translated these over into Adobe XD, where i
made a few other sketch ups.
